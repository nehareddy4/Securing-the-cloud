Securing the cloud: An in-depth review of security threats in cloud computing 

My review paper titled 'Securing the Cloud: An In-Depth Review of Security Threats in Cloud Computing', which was submitted to the International Conference on Contemporary Challenges in Science, Engineering, and its Applications (IC3SEA2023) held at the Study World College of Engineering, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India, from May 05-06, 2023.

In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, cloud computing offers unparalleled benefits. However, with these advantages come significant security concerns that must be addressed to safeguard sensitive data and ensure robust protection. In my paper, I delved into the various security issues cloud computing faces, including system vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, and insecure interfaces. I also discussed proactive solutions to mitigate these risks, emphasizing the importance of encryption technologies, secure APIs, audit tools, and resilient infrastructure.
